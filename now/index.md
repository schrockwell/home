## Work

I'm currently splitting time betwen [Remote Ham Radio](https://www.remotehamradio.com) and [TRMNL](https://trmnl.com).

At RHR, we have been working hard supporting the [Desecho Island DXpedition](https://desecheo2026.com/kp5/). Over 50,000 contacts have been made from the remotely-controlled station on the uninhabited island. It has solar power, Starlink, and two amateur radio stations with radios and antennas. There's even a [realtime stream of contacts](https://clublog.org/livestream/KP5/NP3VI) being made.

At TRMNL we're busy preparing for the launch of the bigger, badder, more capable [TRMNL X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0wQ8gCxCvw).

## Programming

With the assist from Claude, I put together [Stupidly-Simple Environments (SSE)](https://github.com/schrockwell/sse), a tool for managing secret environment variables from development to production.

Now that [Kamal supports local container registries](https://kamal-deploy.org/docs/configuration/docker-registry/#using-a-local-container-registry), that was the final motivation I needed to unify my apps with a [single deployment strategy](/dev/hosting.html). Ruby, Elixir, Go, static sites... they're all Dockerized now. This reduces a ton of friction for iterating on these applications, especially since they're revisited very infrequently. And they all use [SSE](https://github.com/schrockwell/sse) now.

Claude continues to be a huge boon for building and refactoring small, personal projects. For example, it rewrote a basic Ruby Sinatra API into a standalone Go binary, reducing the Docker image from 90 MB to 9 MB, and it's blazing-fast.

## Vintage Tech

I'm in the process of restoring a [Macintosh Classic II](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_classic/specs/mac_classic_ii.html). It has been fully recapped and it boots up and functions well. The original hard drive even works. There is one remaining problem, an issue with the audio that I am trying to track down.

## Media and Games

We're really enjoying the nerd trivia game show [Um, Actually](https://watch.dropout.tv/um-actually).

[Deep Rock Galactic](https://www.deeprockgalactic.com/) is our go-to chill co-op game right now.

## R.I.P. Bucky

We had to say goodbye to our cat Bucky after 13 years. Adopted as a stray named *Cassanova*, he traveled with us across the country, through many homes, jobs, ups, and downs. He was – and will always be – the goodest boy.
